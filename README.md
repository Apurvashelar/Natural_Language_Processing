Natural language Processing commonly known as NLP is the sub-branch of Artificial Intelligence. There are many applications of NLP trending in the sector. One of the application is to predict the product ratings based on explicit reviews by the customers.  
Here particularly we have taken restaurant reviews for prediction.

### How Does It Works  
By the reviews given by the customers, this NLP model will segreget the words as meaningful words which may help to predict the reviews and the words which are not useful for the prediction. With the help of this Bag of Words, our model will predict whether the review is positive or negative. Dataset of reviews is given.

### Steps required  
1. Importing the libraries

3. Remove stopwords  
4. Extract word tokens from the corpus  
5. Cleaning of the texts  
6. Create Bag Of Words model (Get most relevent words only)  
7. Train the model  
8. Predict test set results  


### Installations   
1. import numpy as np
2. import pandas as pd
3. import re
